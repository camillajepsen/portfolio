                        <h4>Hi, my name is Camilla </h4>
                        <br> I am deeply passionate about computer technology and how it can help empower people and solve problems. My love for IT goes back to when my dad who was an electrical engineer gave me my first laptop at 10 years old (That was early back then). After this, I soon discovered that IT has the power to simplify life, fuel innovation and ultimately give us more time.
                        <br><br>
                        I now enjoy doing projects in my free time to make everyday tasks easier and grow my own skills. Just like this webpage :) Github with source code linked below. While studying my bachelor of IT, I have not just learned coding and IT principles, but I have learned the art of software engineering, thinking logically, and most valuably; the skill to unpack principles and learn what I set my mind to. 
                        <br><br>
                        As much as I enjoy the satisfaction of writing and compiling concise and logically beautiful code or exploring concepts of the IT world, I love spending time in nature, doing yoga and connecting with people. My ideal work place is one with a strong team spirit, as I love to collaborate with people, have shared goals and celebrate our successes together.
